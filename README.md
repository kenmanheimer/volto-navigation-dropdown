# volto-navigation-dropdown

Volto website navigation dropdown menu prototype.
  
When ready I plan to release this as a pull request to [plone/volto](https://github.com/plone/volto) and [the volto-menu-customization addon](https://github.com/codesyntax/volto-menu-customization).

It was Created with [voltocli](https://github.com/nzambello/voltocli). I learned about the component to customize from [the volto-menu-customization addon](https://github.com/codesyntax/volto-menu-customization). The [React Semanti-UI Dropown documentation](https://react.semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown) provides key info for developing the functionality.

## Usage

This addon implements nested dropdown menus for site navigation.
